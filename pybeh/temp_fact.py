    returns a Lag-based temporal clustering factor for each subject (Polyn, Norman, & Kahana, 2009)

    INPUTS:
        recalls:    a matrix whose elements are serial positions of recalled
                    items.  The rows of this matrix should represent recalls
                    made by a single subject on a single trial.

        subjects:   a column vector which indexes the rows of recalls
                    with a subject number (or other identifier).  That is,
                    the recall trials of subject S should be located in
                    recalls(find(subjects==S), :)

        list_length:a scalar indicating the number of serial positions in the
                    presented lists.  serial positions are assumed to run
                    from 1:list_length.

       skip_first_n:  an integer indicating the number of recall transitions to
                      to ignore from the start of the recall period, for the
                      purposes of calculating the temporal factor. this can be useful
                      to avoid biasing your results, as the first 2-3 transitions are
                      almost always temporally clustered. note that the first n recalls
                      will still count as already recalled words for the purposes of
                      determining which transitions are possible. (DEFAULT=0)

    OUTPUTS:
        temp_facts: a vector of temporal clustering factors, one
                    for each subject.
