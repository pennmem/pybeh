Please report potential bugs and make feature requests on [github](https://github.com/pennmem/pybeh/issues).

Installation
------------

The only dependency for this toolbox is [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), a popular Python package for scientific computing.

You can use [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to install this dependency if it is not already installed:

  ```
  conda install -y numpy
  ``` 

If you are working on data formats commonly used by the Computational Memory Lab, it is recommended that you install use [PTSA](https://github.com/pennmem/ptsa_new) to facilitate reading in behavioral data into a format usable by the toolbox.

To install from source, download the source code and install:

  ```
  python setup.py install
